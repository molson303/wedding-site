            <p>
              On a snowy night in December of 2014, while Maddie was on winter
              break, she got a call from her friend Kyle to come over and hang
              out at his friend’s (Mike's) Breckenridge rental ski house right
              down the street from her family’s home. Being so close by, she had
              no excuse and trecked down the road. Upon walking in the door,
              Maddie barely made it up the stairs as she was greeted by some
              very large, slobbery dogs. But despite the altitude, steep stairs,
              and the puppies, she persevered and made it to the summit, to find
              a man wearing an argyle sweater, fake glasses, and a smiley face
              hat.

            <h5>THE NUMBER EXCHANGE</h5>
            <p>
              As the night continued, everyone at the house wanted to move the
              party downtown to the bars. Maddie, responsible and studious, was
              the designated driver for that night and that is how she scored
              Mike's phone number. Mike wanting to make sure he could see Maddie
              again put that smiley face hat on her head and let her borrow it
              for the night. But in all reality, Mike just wanted a reason to
              call her the next day, and hopefully, have a new ski buddy.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this initial encounter, their friendship continued to grow
              on the slopes of Breckenridge as ski adventure buddies. Maddie
              worked hard to keep up with Mike in the trees, while Mike
              constantly tried to convince Maddie to be his Tbar partner.

            <p>
              After many trips of the chair lifts together, a night of
              traditional Fondue at the Swiss Haven in Breckenridge, and an
              afternoon adventure snowshoeing, Maddie asked Mike on a formal
              date. It was then mutually decided it would be fun to surprise
              each other with special first dates.
            </p>
            <p>
              So after Maddie asked Mike on this date, it was decided it would
              be fun to surprise one another with a special first dates.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Maddie’s first date for Mike:</u> <br />
              Because of Mike’s love for beer, Maddie took him to Prost Brewery
              in the Highlands neighboorhood to test his taste buds. She
              blindfolded him, got him a fight of beers, and by smell only he
              had to decipher the flavors, type, and ABV of the beers. She then
              took him to dinner at the trendy Root Down restaurant, and to
              finish the night, Maddie presented a special dessert she had
              created. Knowing Mike’s love of ice cream cake and that his
              favorite color was blue, she crafted these innovative blue
              ice-cream cake cupcakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Mike’s first date for Maddie:</u> <br />
              Mike made reservations to take Maddie to the famous Boulder,
              Colorado Oak restaurant. Unfortunately, on their arrival, the
              restaurant had a fire, so they improvised and went to Ted’s
              Montana grill. After dinner, Mike revealed his big surprise
              adventure and took Maddie to a “Sip and Paint” event, where they
              drank wine and attempted to paint Van Gogh’s Cafe Terrace at
              Night. After showing off their elementary paint skills to each
              other, they finished the night with their mutual favorite dessert:
              Mochi!

            <h5>HOW WE REALLY FIRST MET</h5>
            <p>
              Upon reactivating Mike’s twitter account, in anticipation for
              Maddie to track his mileage for his first half marathon in the
              Fall of 2018, a one of a kind green tie-dye ski jacket was spotted
              in one of his tweets from 2012. Because of that jacket, Maddie
              knew that was her in the picture, and both her and Mike sat
              staring at the photo and date in disbelief. This Epic Mix photo
              (aka- photo from a camera man on the ski hill) showing a picture
              of Kyle, Brandon, Mike, Maddie and a few others from 2012 is
              evidence that these two had met before, and luckily fate brought
              them back together again in the snowy town of Breckenridge.

            <p>
              Maddie, still in undergrad had to head back to Tacoma, WA to
              finish her last year. Mike not wanting to let her go flew out 1-2x
              a month to see her. This was a very special time, as Mike was able
              to experience Tacoma with Maddie, attend her formal events, and
              also see her walk during graduation.

            <h5>ENGAGEMENT</h5>
            <p>
              September 8, 2018-The best day ever...until June 26, 2021. <br />
              Unbeknown to Maddie, Mike and his mother had been spending almost
              every weekend for the last few months looking for the perfect
              engagement ring. After months of shopping, lunch dates, digital
              and wax mockups Mike and his mother finally created the perfect
              ring. With Maddie's birthday right around the corner, Mike decided
              to surprise her with what she thought was an early birthday
              weekend escape in Vail, CO. As they left Denver to head up to the
              mountains, they received a call from Barbara who wanted to meet up
              to give Maddie her birthday gift, a backpack Yetti cooler with
              picknick items the two could enjoy during their hike. With the
              gift in hand, the couple, along with Rockie, drove up to Beaver
              Creek for a day of hiking in the mountains. Hiking for over 2
              hours, they got near the top of Beaver Creek, on the Red Buffalo
              ski run, and with their tummies growling they decided to
              investigate what was in this cooler. <br />
              The very first thing packed at the top of the cooler was a
              blindfold labeled for Maddie. With her face up the mountain,
              blindfolded, Mike prepared Rockie with a bandana, set up the
              picnic scene, and got on one knee. Turning around, Maddie faced
              her soon to be husband, on his knee, holding a ring while Rockie,
              wore a "Will you marry me" bandana.
